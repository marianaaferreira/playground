This repository is a space for experimentation, where I explore various programming languages, concepts, and ideas. Here, you'll find code snippets, small projects, and tests with new technologies, frameworks, and libraries. It's a place where I can practice what I'm learning, test out hypotheses, and experiment without any constraints.
The purpose of this repository is to learn and have fun experimenting with new techniques and tools. Itâ€™s not focused on production-ready projects, but on gaining hands-on knowledge.
